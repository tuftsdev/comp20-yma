This Git repository is my portfolio for COMP 20, showcasing what I've built based off of what I learned in this class.

My favorite assignment/lab has been my website, Assignment 1, because it was mainly consisting of simple HTML and CSS, which I've learned before coming to this class, so that was easy.

I belive I have grown a lot since Day 1.

The most important thing I've learned in this course is proper software engineering practice for the real world. In Assigment 2, we had to commit often on Git, version control software. Plus for Assignment 2 and the semester group project, there are APIs that can work for us rather than we rewrite the code. Also, in Assignment 3, we got to modify a piece of open-source software rather than recreate it from scratch.

I would like to delve deeper into security. This is an important topic in this world, and not a lot of CS majors graduate with any knowledge of it.
