This Git repository is my portfolio for COMP 20, showcasing what I've built based off of what I learned in this class.

My favorite assignment/lab has been my website, Assignment 1, because it was mainly consisting of simple HTML and CSS, which I've learned before coming to this class, so that was easy.

I belive I have grown a lot since Day 1.

The most important thing I've learned in this course is proper software engineering practice for the real world. In Assigment 2, we had to commit often on Git, version control software. Plus for Assignment 2 and the semester group project, there are APIs that can work for us rather than we rewrite the code. Also, in Assignment 3, we got to modify a piece of open-source software rather than recreate it from scratch.

I would like to delve deeper into machine learning and artificial intelligence, because with so much data in this world right now and in the near future, all of it needs to be manipulated in some way. I am also interested in where the intelligence in computing goes. Plus, I'm not too into SnapFace.
