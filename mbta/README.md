README.md for Assignment 2
Closest MBTA Station

The map on page, geolocation information and marker, polyline of red line,
custom markers for each station, black polyline between user and nearest
station, infowindow on user's location showing distance between user and
nearest station, Haversine formula, and train schedules on each station's
infowindow have all been implemented correctly.

I did this assignment alone, but special thanks to Ming for office hours help,
including showing me that the retrieved JSON API info only lives within the
onreadystatechange handler function when the API returns 200, and assuring that
an alert window for a 404 return from the API is acceptable, including its
GET 404 error on the console.

Code for Haversine formula learned from
